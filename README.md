# MUT（Multitasking learning）

A multi-task learning library constructed by combining MMsegmentation, MMyolo and MMDetection can realize the functions of road segmentation, vehicle pedestrian detection and lane detection at the same time.

Advantages:
1. Convenient management of multiple algorithm collocation
2. Convenient algorithm iteration update
3. Easy to debug, easy to use
